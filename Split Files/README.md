# livesplit_asl_mgs1
## Default Split Files

* The first time you run the autosplitter, you select a `Default Settings Template`, which defines which splits are initially enabled.
* If you don't change any settings, you can use the `split files` provided here.
* If you do customise your splits, consider using `Build Split File for current settings` in the `MGS Autosplitter Toolbox` to build custom split files instead.

# Available Templates
* The number of splits shown is taken from the Glitchless category - other categories may have fewer splits.

## Major Splits only (17 splits)
* Defeating each boss
* Leaving Armory after collecting the PSG-1
* Clearing the rappel down Comms Tower A
* Entering Warehouse to freeze the PAL Key
* Entering Blast Furnace to heat the PAL Key 

## Major Splits, plus pre-boss Splits (27 splits)
All splits included in `Major Splits Only`, plus:
* Entering the cutscene before each boss

## All available Splits (122 splits)
Every split provided by the autosplitter - generally every area clear involved in progressing the game

## Major Splits, plus most Other Splits (120 splits)
All splits included in `All available Splits`, except:
* Going from the torture sequence to the Medi Room
* Reaching the disc change on console

## Major Splits, plus most Other Splits (with Boba skip) (118 splits)
All splits included in `Major Splits, plus most Other Splits`, except:

# Boba skip
* All templates will split "correctly", whether you perform the Boba skip or not.
* The template `(with Boba skip)` does not include, or split for, the areas skipped by Boba skip.
* Other templates do include those splits, but the autosplitter will `skip` them in LiveSplit to stay on track if you perform Boba skip.
